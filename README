=== Summary ===

ros-lm_sensors is a small wrapper around lm_sensors [1] that
pushes the output of the detected sensors into ROS diagnostics.
Each sensor is published as a separate diagnostic and the status
is determined by the status of the sensors alarm.

This package requires that lm_sensors is installed.

=== License ===
The source code of this package is licensed under the BSD 3
clause license.  However, as the package does link against the
GPL licensed libsensors, the distribution as a whole is
considered to fall under the GPL.

=== Building ===
The environment must be setup such that ROS is functioning.  Then
the standard cmake process will suffice.

$ source /opt/ros/<distribution>/setup.sh
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ../
$ make
